    bio: "I'm a Virginia native, but have lived in North Carolina most of my life. I graduated from UNC Charlotte in 2013 with a B.A. in Sociology. Since then, I have been a working professional in the field of scholarly publishing, which in turn, has made me more focused on my career as a developer. I've been focuing on web-development at my current position and have taught myself some of the basic fundamentals of JavaScript. I graduated from the UNC Coding Bootcamp in September of 2021 and am now a professional developer seeking full-time work!",
