    bio: " I'm a Virginia native, but have lived in North Carolina most of my life. I graduated from UNC Charlotte in 2013 with a Sociological Psych. degree. Since then, I have been a working professional in the field of scholarly publishing, which in turn, has made me more focused on my career as a developer. From 2020 til today, I've been focuing on web-development at my current position and have taught myself some of the basic fundamentals of JavaScript. I graduated from the UNC Coding Bootcamp in September of 2021 and am now a professional developer seeking full-time work!",
